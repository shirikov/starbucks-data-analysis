    "Then, we create a new data frame that captures information on each offer each user received. Each row in this data frame includes information on a particular offer received by a particular user: when the offer was received, and whether and when it was viewed or completed. To create the data, we loop through all users in the transaction data set, and for each user, we reconstruct what happened with respect to a particular offer by looking at all the transactions with the corresponding offer id in the period when the offer was active.

Given that offer duration is sometimes longer than a week, in some of these cases, two offers with the same id were active simultaneously for a few days, and if offer viewing or completion happened in that specific period, there is no way to determine which of these two identical offers was viewed or completed because the same offer sent multiple times always has the same id. However, this issue is not severe, as in the overwhelming majority of cases, offers were viewed or completed soon after they were sent (or not viewed/completed at all), as the histograms below will show. A manual inspection of the original transactions data set with respect to specific users who had multiple identical offers in a row has also shown that this problem is very rare. "

The original user data includes a variable *became_member_on* that is a date when the user created a member account. If we assume that the test (sending the offers) began on August 1, 2018, we can calculate how many months one has been a member when they received a specific offer. (This assumption is based on the fact that the latest signing-up date in the data set is at the end of July 2018. However, even if the test started on a later date, this won't affect the conclusions in terms of whether more recent members would be more or less likely to redeem offers.)"
