    "One caveat about this recovery process is that in some cases, users were sent the same offer two or more weeks in a row. Given that offer duration is sometimes longer than a week, in some of these cases, two offers with the same id were active simultaneously for a few days, and if offer viewing or completion happened in that specific period, there is no way to determine which of these two identical offers was viewed or completed because the same offer sent multiple times always has the same id. However, this issue is not severe, as in the overwhelming majority of cases, offers were viewed or completed soon after they were sent (or not viewed/completed at all), as the histograms below will show. A manual inspection of the original transactions data set with respect to specific users who had multiple identical offers in a row has also shown that this problem is very rare. "
